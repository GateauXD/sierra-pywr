# Overview

The San Francisco Water System Model (SFWSM) brings together several methods and tools to create a comprehensive modeling platform for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) water supply system. This describes these tools generally, indicates where to go for further reading, and gives some specific examples of San Francisco-specific modeling logic.

Note that this does not describe the specific operational logic of the facility.

# SFWSM structure

The SFWSM is comprised of:
1. a data management system for organizing the water system network and storing data
2. generalized modeling logic and code
3. facility-specific modeling logic and code
4. a graphical user interface (GUI) accessed via [OpenAgua](www.openagua.org), to facilitate interacting with the data and model.

Though the GUI is useful, it is not strictly necessary to run the model, or even edit data. However, the data storage services are necessary as of writing, and editing data without the GUI would be difficult, and describing how to do so is beyond the scope of this readme. Because of the importance of the GUI in practice, OpenAgua is described generally first, followed by data management and modeling details.

# Graphical User Interface

[OpenAgua](https://www.openagua.org), the GUI used for the SFWSM, is a web-based application to facilitate interacting with water system data and models. The purpose of OpenAgua is to view/edit water system data online, run models, and visualize model results. Aside from logging into and using OpenAgua at www.openagua.org, the [OpenAgua documentation](http://docs.openagua.org) is the best place to learn more, although it is a work-in-progress.

# Data management

Data is stored in three places in the SFWSM:

1. a database managed by **Hydra Platform**, a data management service developed by the water resources group at the University of Manchester
2. a database managed by **OpenAgua**
3. data files such as CSV files stored on **Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3**.

## Hydra Platform data

Hydra Platform provides a database model (schema) that organizes water system information in a manner conducive to modeling. Specifically, the database schema organizes water systems into discrete networks, which are comprised of connected nodes (e.g., reservoirs, treatment plants, etc.) and links (e.g., rivers, pipelines, etc.). Each network *resource* (node, link, or the network as a whole), has one or more *attributes* (e.g., "reservoir capacity"), which may also be called *variables*. The whole network may also have variables attached to it, such as climate conditions or any generic variable that cannot be ascribed to a specific individual facility.

In addition to organizing the network, Hydra Platform also stores data values associated with resources and their attributes. These may be as scalars, time series, arrays, or descriptors.

**IMPORTANT**: Though Hydra Platform stores primary data (scalars, time series, etc.), OpenAgua introduces the concept of *functions*. These functions are written in Python, and return a value in any given time step. This concept is discussed below, along with examples specific to the SFWSM. Documentation about the functions, which are not unique to the SFWSM, can be found at [https://openagua.github.io/waterlp-general](https://openagua.github.io/waterlp-general) (as with the general OpenAgua documentation, this is a work-in-progress).

The database model also has *scenarios* to organize data that might change under different conditions or assumptions. Scenarios may be used for organizing both input and output. In the OpenAgua interface, scenarios are (currently) organized as *options*, *portfolios*, and *scenarios*, where options are management interventions and scenarios are external conditions (e.g., climate).

Hydra Platform also provides a web API to create and edit data. Though this is not elaborated on here, this API is used directly by the SFWSM when running a model. Specifically, the API is used to read data and write results.

## OpenAgua data

OpenAgua stores supplemental data in addition to core network structure and dataset values. Example supplemental data includes:

* Chart/table information for viewing results and saving favorite results
* Model run information, to connect the generalized model engine with OpenAgua

This data is only relevant when using the OpenAgua application

## AWS S3 data

Sometimes it makes more sense to store water system data in CSV files instead of in the database. The best example of this is hydrologic input data derived from the hydrologic models. It is far more convenient to store inflow time series, for example, as CSV files rather than as database structures. To address this, OpenAgua connects with [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to allow users to save CSV files online, via the OpenAgua interface. With the appropriate credentials, this data can then be read by the generalized model engine during a model run.

# Modeling logic

The general modeling approach for the SFWSM (and OpenAgua generally) is to use a generalized model engine with facility-specific data and operating rules.

## Generalized model logic

* LP
* Zero foresight with option of adding foresight
* Core concepts...
* Refer to paper writeup & other documentation
* Links to code (this repository)

## Specific modeling logic

To the extent possible, specific modeling logic is not included in this generalized code, but rather entered into the Hydra database via the OpenAgua GUI.

That modeling logic is described in a [separate Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19qTpzT-JEKpwmsF28UgYSVeF0gQW1batZOGd7pwBsF8/edit?usp=sharing)

### Examples

# Running the model

There are three ways to set up the model: from the OpenAgua interface, with the command line interface, and with a Python integrated development environment.

## from within OpenAgua

This mode is used when the model will be run using the OpenAgua interface, the most likely scenario.

## with the command line interface (CLI)

This mode is likely seldom used, but nonetheless can be necessary, such as when running the model via SSH.

## with a Python Integrated Development Environment

This mode is most likely used when developing the generalized model logic and debugging the facility-specific logic.

# Installation

Installation partly depends on how the model will be run, as described above.
